# Hi, I'm Alejandro

I started at Amazon in operations—the kind of work where you're moving fast. Eventually, I moved into Business Intelligence Engineer in Luxembourg, which felt natural. But here's the thing: my team was quite strong in data engineering. These people lived and breathed pipelines, infrastructure, and scale. I had to adapt.

That adaptation changed everything. I went from analyzing data to building the systems that make analysis possible in the first place.

## What I Do Now

I'm a **Data Engineer**, and a big part of my work has involved moving petabytes of data.

I've also built full-stack applications—backends, frontends, UIs, the whole stack—and regular websites when the project calls for it.

But honestly? The best moment in programming is when this thing that you are working on finally works.

Also, sometimes I do some vibe coding. Just testing a fresh idea, proving a concept works, no pressure.

### The Stack I Work With

**Cloud & Infrastructure**  
![AWS](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-232F3E?style=flat&logo=amazon-aws&logoColor=white)

AWS is my home base. My favorite service? **Lambda**. Here's why: most courses teach you how to program, but they never teach you how to execute your code somewhere other than your laptop. 

Lambda changed how I think about deploying logic—fast, scalable, and without managing servers.(I also like docker)

I've also spent serious time with enormous Redshift clusters, S3 data lakes, Glue, Step Functions, and pretty much every data service AWS offers.

**Data Engineering**

![Apache Spark](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apache_Spark-E25A1C?style=flat&logo=apache-spark&logoColor=white)
![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-316192?style=flat&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)

**Full-Stack Development**  
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=flat&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)
![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-339933?style=flat&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-007ACC?style=flat&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)

**AI & Agentic Workflows**  
![LangChain](https://img.shields.io/badge/LangChain-121212?style=flat&logo=chainlink&logoColor=white)

I'm currently getting deep into **agentic workflows** and AI applications—specifically RAG systems and frameworks like LangChain. The intersection of data engineering and AI feels like where things are heading, and I want to be there as it unfolds.

## My Philosophy on Building

I love open source. You don't need to reinvent the wheel for every project. Most of the time, there's already a solid open-source solution out there—you just need to adapt it, host it yourself, and make it yours. This approach has saved me countless hours.

## Teaching & Sharing

I'm also a **Professor of Data Science and AI** at **Nuclio Digital School**. My teaching philosophy is simple: learn by doing. You can read all the theory you want, but until you've built something, broken it, and fixed it, you haven't really learned it.

If you're working on something interesting—data pipelines, AI experiments, scaling challenges—I'd love to hear about it. I really enjoy meeting people who are passionate about this stuff and exchanging ideas or thoughts.

## When I'm Not Coding

You'll find me outdoors. Hiking, running, playing padel, biking, climbing anything that gets me moving and away from a screen.
